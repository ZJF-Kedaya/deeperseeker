    Review fix (PR #26, High): the previous eviction loop shared by
    _sig_locks/_chat_locks scanned the oldest MAX//2+1 entries, broke out when
    ALL of them were locked, and then setdefault'ed the new key anyway — so
    under sustained load with many live chats the dict grew without bound; the
    "memory-leak guard" was the leak. Semantics now:
      - a hit moves the key to the most-recently-used end;
      - over cap, the least-recently-used UNLOCKED entry is evicted (a locked
        entry is never evicted — that would fork a chat's critical section;
        worst case stays one benign re-creation race, as before);
      - if EVERY entry is held, the new key is STILL registered, growing the
        registry over cap. Addendum: an earlier draft returned a shared
        fallback lock WITHOUT registering the key — that traded the memory
        bound for a correctness one. If pressure dropped while that request
        was still in flight, the next request for the same chat found room,
        created a fresh per-key lock, and two live holders sat in one chat's
        critical section — reopening the exact parent_message_id race Stage
        0.3 exists to close, precisely under the load the branch was designed
        for. Registering over cap keeps same chat -> same lock object
        unconditionally. The cost stays bounded: over-cap entries appear only
        when every existing lock is held (in-flight pressure), so depth
        tracks request concurrency during pressure windows — never total chat
        history — and drained entries are inert until recycled by LRU churn.
        Each over-cap registration logs a warning with the live depth: the
        ops signal for sustained pressure (raise the cap if it fires
        continuously).
